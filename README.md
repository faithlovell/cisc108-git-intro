# cisc108-git-intro
Learning about Git &amp; GitHub in CISC108H!

Create a branch in this repository named [your first name]-[your last name]-branch to get credit for today's lecture!
Ex. faith-lovell-branch

## Also, here is what some Markdown syntax looks like
##notice that if I don't add a space after the #, it doesn't apply a header

*This is what a task list looks like (which will be useful for you soon!)*
- [ ] I have a task that needs to be done
- [x] And a task that's already done!
- [ ] **And a task in bold**

~~Codeblocks too, and I can cross out this title~~
```
print("Hello World")
my_name = "Faith"
```

To have syntax highlighting, put the word `python` in there:

```python
print("Hello world!")
prof_name = "Dr. Bart"
```
